# Fetal_ECG_Extraction
Developed a methodology for extraction fetal electrocardiogram signal from the abdominal signals with arrhythmia prediction using machine learning tools.

•	Applied ICA (Independent Component Analysis), PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to process abdominal signals and extract fetal ECG signal \ maternal signal component.
•	Used adaptive filtering to reduce the influence of the maternal signal component in the fetal ECG signal.
•	Computed vectors of features coefficients for ECG signals with and without arrhythmia using autoregressive model by Burg algorithm.
